## Overview

A collections of interview attempts that are not dense enough to be its own repo.
- This can be either 
    - a live coding session
        - where the answer is exactly the same as completed in the interview
        - or the answer is attempted again quickly after the interview when I was completely mind stuck at the time
    - a 'bring-home' assignment
        - this should be a minority as usually the challenge will be dense enough to have its own repo.
