## Overview

A collection of interview attempts that are not dense enough to be its own repo.
- This can be either 
    - a live coding session
        - where the answer is exactly the same as completed in the interview, Or
        - the answer is attempted again quickly after the interview (most likely mind stuck at the time ;P)
    - a 'bring-home' assignment
        - this should be a minority as usually the challenge will be dense enough to have its own repo.
        - example: [BillUsageSystem](https://github.com/wizlee/BillUsageSystem)
